ABOUT:

  The following is an organized compliation of all the scripts and documentation I directly worked on for this project. At the 
  moment there is no fully working build of the project due to more recent changes to the project. The project itself was made
  for UCI's Video Game Development Club as a year long project that's been in development from October 2015 to August 2016. 
  The project as of now is currently on hiatus.
